# vinylstation
Transform a Raspberry Pi (4, or 3+) into a webradio streaming engine (Icecast and HLS output) for vinyl records. Grabs metadata from Shazaam for played records

This script leverages OpenSource projects Liquidsoap (https://github.com/savonet), songrec (https://github.com/marin-m/SongRec) and all of their related libraries.
Endless thanks go to the developers of these projects.

**Requirements:**

- Raspberry Pi 4 or 3b+ with internet access
- Micro SD card (8Gb is enough)
- A USB (Phono Preamp) sound interface **Note**: In fact, you can hook up any analog audio source, as the underlying software is source media agnostic.
